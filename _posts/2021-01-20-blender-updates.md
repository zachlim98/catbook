title: Timeout for Blender!
categories: [thoughts]
---

This is just a really quick update that the number of articles I've been posting here has slowed somewhat because I've been taking timeout to learn Blender for a particular project I've been working on. It requires modelling of certain self-built components and I've had to dive deeper into Blender in order to really get it modelled properly. 

Stay tuned for more data-related projects though! Have a couple of ideas up my sleeve which I'll get onto when I'm done with Blender.
