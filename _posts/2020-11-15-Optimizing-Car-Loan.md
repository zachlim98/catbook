# Introduction 

Many articles have been written on the ‘true’ cost of owning a car in Singapore ([Here](https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/car-maintenance-cost-in-singapore), [here](https://blog.seedly.sg/factors-cost-car-price-singapore/), and [here](https://dollarsandsense.sg/2018-edition-cost-owning-car-singapore-10-years/)). And these articles have done well in laying out roughly how much one should expect to pay for a car. But one aspect that these articles have not covered is the *opportunity costs* of owning a car.

As financially responsible people, we all know that we should (a) Save and (b) Invest the savings. So when we buy a car, this ability to save and invest seemingly goes down the drain… or does it? In this article, I want to show you (with the help of [this nifty tool](https://nosparechange.com/car-loan-optimizer/)) that this does not always have to be the case. In fact, there are optimal downpayments and loan terms that one can take when buying a new car to these investment opportunity costs as much as possible!

# Assumptions

The tool (as with all estimators) makes a few assumptions, namely:

1. The return on investment (ROI) of your investments remain relatively constant over 10 years (a **big** assumption, I know but we can always estimate a lower ROI to account for bad years)
2. Your monthly investments/car payment budget doesn’t change over the 10 years

While these assumptions may seem a little far out, I would argue that these are *good* assumptions because they assume ‘worst-case’ scenarios. This means that whatever the tool estimates will be the **safest** optimal estimates.

# Case Study #1: Cheapest Car, Average Budget

One of the [cheapest cars](https://dollarsandsense.sg/5-cheapest-cars-singapore-can-buy-2020/) currently is the Perodua Bezza which comes in at $64,999. Let’s assume your salary is ~$3000 and this allows you to have a monthly budget of ~$700. This $700 is what you intend to **save and invest** but will also use to **pay for your car**. So, inputs as follows:

- **Price of Car:** $64,999
- **Monthly Expenses:** $500 (Fuel, parking, servicing etc.)
- **Bank Loan Interest Rate:** 3%
- **Return on Investments (Annual):** 7% ([annualized return](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/18/the-sp-500-has-already-met-its-average-return-for-a-full-year.html#:~:text=The average annualized total return,percent%2C according to LPL Financial.) of S&P500 is 9%)
- **Monthly Budget**: $700

Some takeaways from this:

- *The best way to maximize your ROI is to pay for the car fully and take the shortest loan term.* This makes sense because you would be able to start committing more of your $700 every month into investing.
- *If you don’t want to ‘lose’ money, you would have to pay at least* ***42k\*** *in downpayment.* This is assuming you decide to take a 7 year loan term.
- *Anything below the $0 line meant you* ***overspent\*** *your monthly budget of $700.* This results in you not having any money to invest for the entire duration of your loan term, eating away at your ability to save and invest

# Case Study #2: Cheapest Car, Above-Average Budget

Here, we return to our beloved Perodua Bezza but we get a glimpse of the power of compounding if we are able to start investing early. We assume that your salary is slightly higher at ~$5500 and so your monthly budget is **$1200**.

*p.s. you can play with an interactive version of this* [*here*](https://nosparechange.com/car-loan-optimizer/)

More takeaways:

- *With a higher budget, you can consider taking a longer loan term.* Notice how the 7 yr loan term **crosses over** the 6, 5, and 4 yr loan terms. That’s because with a higher budget, it makes sense to maybe pay *less* each month (i.e. take a longer loan term) and have more leftover to invest.
- *A budget of $1200 more than covers the monthly costs*. Note how none of the payoffs are negative.

# Case Study #3: Average Car, Average Budget

Maybe the Perodua Bezza really doesn’t cut it for you. You decide to go for the [most popular car](https://www.valuechampion.sg/average-cost-cars-singapore#:~:text=We calculated this figure based,Mazda3 sells for S%2499%2C800.) in Singapore — a Toyota Corolla Altis at ~$94,000. Your salary is slightly higher at ~$4000 but you’re paying off a new flat, so your budget remains the same at only ~$700. Same inputs as above, the only change is the car price.

More takeaways:

- *Compared to the cheaper car, your downpayment would have to be a lot higher.* A monthly budget of $700 just doesn’t seem to cut it for this price range. Want to not lose out on investment returns? Be prepared to pay at least 62k in downpayment for a 4 year loan term

# Conclusion

Buying a car in Singapore is expensive and it makes sense to optimize your downpayments and loan terms. From the case studies above, we see that there are, in fact, downpayment+loan term combinations that allow you to continue to invest and hence decrease the opportunity costs.
